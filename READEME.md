## User Stories
* I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
* I want to view a list of animals I have logged.
* I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older).
* I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.

## Additional Features to add
* Display of the total number of caretakers needed in a day.
* Add a property that records when each animal was admitted. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
* Expand the application to differentiate between animals' species. Group the animals into those categories. Then include a component to display the total needed caretakers for whichever species the user selects.
* Add a new master component to average the total age for each species.
* Show animals based on diet type. Then, show all animals who eat meat (carnivores AND omnivores)
